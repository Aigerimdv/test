Whether I have lived well to this day or badly, I have come a long way.
There was plenty of everything in this life: disputes, painful gossip,
and struggle, and unworthy quarrels... But now, when the end of the road
s already visible,when I am exhausted and tired from the bottom of my heart,
I am convinced of my futility good intentions, vanity and frailty of an easy life..
